# PCB Defect Detection - Module 1
# PCB Defect Detection System

## Objective

This project implements **Module 1: Dataset Setup and Image Subtraction** for PCB defect detection using classical image processing techniques. The goal is to convert template-test PCB image pairs into clean binary masks that highlight manufacturing defects.
This project implements a complete **PCB defect detection pipeline** using classical image processing and deep learning. The system detects and classifies 6 types of manufacturing defects in printed circuit boards.

**Current Status**: ✅ Module 1 (Image Subtraction) + ✅ Module 2 (ROI Extraction) Implemented
